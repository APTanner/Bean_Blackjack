## Features
### Abstract State-Tracking Architecture
- Utilizes an abstract GameState class to represent and manage functionality for each game state
- Streamlines code by isolating the logic for individual game stages

### Card Loading
- Simple tooling to automatically load all cards and their textures into a CardData ScriptableObject
- Eliminates the need for manual data entry, saving time on updating card faces and textures
